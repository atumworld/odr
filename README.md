# odr

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of odr is to provide an R interface to Rust code for processing
origin-destination data.

The development of the package was done using the development version of
the `rextendr` package.

``` r
remotes::install_github("extendr/rextendr")
```

The package template was created as follows:

``` r
usethis::use_description()
rextendr::use_extendr()
```
