# odr

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of odr is to provide an R interface to Rust code for processing origin-destination data.

The development of the package was done using the development version of the `rextendr` package.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("extendr/rextendr")
```

The package template was created as follows:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
usethis::use_description()
rextendr::use_extendr()

```
